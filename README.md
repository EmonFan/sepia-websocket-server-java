# SEPIA Chat-Server

The WebSocket based Chat-Server is a hub that makes asynchronous user-to-user and user-to-assistant communication possible and can be used to push data to connected clients and devices as well.
SEPIAs running on the Assist-Server can log-in to the Chat-Server the same way a user does (via a SEPIA client) and post messages to different channels.
