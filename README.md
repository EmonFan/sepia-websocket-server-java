# SEPIA Chat-Server

The WebSocket based Chat-Server is a hub that makes asynchronous user-to-user and user-to-assistant communication possible and can be used to push data to connected clients and devices as well.
SEPIAs running on the [Assist-Server](https://github.com/SEPIA-Framework/sepia-assist-server) can log-in to the Chat-Server the same way a user does via a [SEPIA client](https://github.com/SEPIA-Framework/sepia-html-client-app) 
and post messages to different channels.
